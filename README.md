# WebMemory - WebMemory - API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UdL-EPS-SoftArch/webmemory-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UdL-EPS-SoftArch/webmemory-api/branches) 

## Vision

This project is a **competitive online game**
It is for players who want to play a multiplayer memory game with their friends or random people

Allows other players to play with friends and earn rewards, 
unlike existing memory games that are mainly played localy and by two players only
our game has the same capacity our servers have, meaning a lot of players can play the game simultaneously
